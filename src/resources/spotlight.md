# Role Spotlight

**Company:** CSL Behring
**Role:** Data Scientist

**Description:**
Currently, I serve as a functional expert in natural language processing, machine learning, and generative AI. I build AI-powered data retrieval tools using retrieval augmented generation (RAG) with fine-tuned embedding models to make information more accessible across the organization.

I led the development of a conversational AI tool that leverages plasma donor reviews to provide actionable insights for donation center managers, driving approximately a 15% improvement in average review scores. I also deployed an internal chatbot that enables private and secure conversations with GPT and Llama 3 models.

My work focuses on fine-tuning large language models for domain-specific tasks, building production AI systems, and translating complex business needs into practical generative AI solutions.
